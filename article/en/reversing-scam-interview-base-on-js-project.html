            Previously, I would like to share my personal experience regarding an interview that ended in a scam, which is actually dangerous for us 
            because our data can be stolen unknowingly (because the interview is live & screen sharing with the person concerned, so if we are not focused, 
            we might get hacked). Fortunately, in my case, the attacker did not succeed in carrying out his action. Here is the story.

            On an afternoon, I casually opened LinkedIn. 
            There was a chat notification from someone offering a full-time remote position; here is the chat:
             
            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/1.png" style="width: 530px;height: 160px;">
            
            With an offer like that, I was very interested. Then he made a link for the interview level using Google Meet.

            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/2.png" style="width: 530px;height: 160px;">

            After that, I was interviewed by him and asked what projects I had worked on, what role I had, and my salary expectations. 
            Then, he asked for my GitHub user.I was invited to a project using Node.js, and he asked me to share my screen 
            because he said this was a screening stage (so far there is nothing suspicious).
            
            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/3.png" style="width: 530px;height: 160px;">

            After being invited, I was told to read about the project and the clone project.

            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/4.png" style="width: 680px;height: 400px;">

            I have also cloned the project, and then I always check for malicious functions such as eval 
            (why eval??? because the eval function is able to execute strings as code. If the string comes from an untrusted source (such as user input), 
            then the attacker can insert malicious code to be executed. You can read more here or in other articles <a target="_blank" href="https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/04/19/how-evil-is-eval/">how-evil-is-eval</a>.

            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/5.png" style="width: 880px;height: 200px;">

            I realized there was a very suspicious file in the file <span>./server/app.js:152</span> Here's the code

            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/6.png" style="width: 500px;height: 470px;">
            sure enough, the function is called when calling <span>utils.assets()</span> in the file <span>./server/config/util.js</span>

            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/7.png" style="width: 500px;height: 270px;">
            
            also, i check these file <span>./public/models/.svn/bower_components/assets</span>
            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/8.png" style="width: 881px;height: 29px;">

            Then, in the interview session. I told the interviewer (nice try diddy, and end-call).

            There is a thing where I suspect the JavaScript code is obfuscated. Usually, there are many reasons the code is obfuscated  
            such as the code hard to read by people, avoid from reversing to know the flow code & some they put malicious code (allowing us to steal important files on our pc)

            I will divide it into several parts:
            1. <a href="#static-analisis">Static Analisis</a>
            2. <a href="#dynamic-analysis">Dynamic Analysis & Simulation</a>

            <h1 id="static-analisis" style="width: 180px;margin-left: 87px;">Static Analysis</h1>

            This reversing, I will focus on the JavaScript function section,you can check in <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sohay666/8089c68a7f28a47d85612ba43a525c2e/raw/7836d0f7de0f2eb9bb01b08988b7a738f7f2b40e/js.malscript" target="_blank">here</a>
            The code can be checked after de-obfuscated (however there are still some codes that need to be tidied up so that they can still be read) <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sohay666/238c8bc117ee7ae30f04f73d74527f68/raw/5a0992bf47067d2404f687054b9d7afec8e6d413/js.malscript.dec" target="_blank">here</a>

            Also, there are some functions that I skip. So I only discuss the important functions.
            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/9.png" style="width: 780px;height: 380px;">
            in the function <span>_0x3c0bfd</span> looks to get information like <span>hostname</span>, <span>platform</span>, <span>homedir</span> & <span>tmpdir</span> 
            then initial host to <span>http://86.104.74.51:1224</span>
            
            I check the host, it has been created since the date <span>2024-03-28</span>

            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/10.png" style="width: 780px;height: 580px;">

            In addition, the obfuscated code will take sensitive data such as:

            <span>1.</span><span>Wallet config Solana</span> (If you are a cryptocurrency player, you are already familiar with this)
            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/11.png" style="width: 780px;height: 80px;">

            <span>2.</span><span>Firefox</span> (Can steal password information stored in the Firefox browser)
            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/12.png" style="width: 780px;height: 80px;">

            <span>3.</span><span>Wallet Exodus</span> (wallet used to store crypto)
            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/13.png" style="width: 780px;height: 80px;">

            <span>4.</span><span>Keychain</span> (Like password management which can store information such as passwords, Mac users are certainly familiar with it)
            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/14.png" style="width: 780px;height: 80px;">
            
            <span>5.</span><span>Chrome</span>  (can steal password information stored in the Chrome browser)
            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/15.png" style="width: 780px;height: 80px;">

            <span>6.</span> <span>Brave Browser</span> (can steal password information stored in the Brave browser)
            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/16.png" style="width: 780px;height: 80px;">

            <span>7.</span><span>App Data/Config App</span> (will steal some config info on each installed application)
            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/17.png" style="width: 780px;height: 115px;">

            then after getting the important information, it will be uploaded to the server <span>http://86.104.74.51:1224/uploads</span> 
            with method http <span>POST</span>
            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/18.png" style="width: 780px;height: 180px;">

            <h1 id="dynamic-analysis" style="width: 180px;margin-left: 87px;">Dynamic Analysis</h1>
            The first step, prepare VMware or a special environment to avoid attacks and change the host to localhost,
            example : <span>http://86.104.74.51:1224</span> to <span>http://127.0.0.1:1224</span>, so after changed to localhost server.
            don't forget to use <span>debugger</span>.

            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/19.png" style="width: 780px;height: 75px;">

            after that open <span>Chrome DevTools</span> with access <span>chrome://inspect</span> and click <span>Open dedicated DevTools for Node</span>
            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/20.png" style="width: 780px;height: 175px;">
            
            After that, the console will automatically open like this, then click Step.
            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/21.png" style="width: 780px;height: 275px;">
            we can see the contents of each variable

            <span style="color:#04ebf5">_0x1e3887</span>: <span>sohais-MacBook-Air.local</span> // hostname
            <span style="color:#04ebf5">_0x20b1f0</span>: <span>darwin</span> // platform
            <span style="color:#04ebf5">_0x4753a5</span>: <span>/Users/sohai</span> // homedir
            <span style="color:#04ebf5">_0x171a9c</span>: <span>/var/folders/d_/865r6lh90g5cn8bcy1p99z6m0000gn/T</span> //tmpdir

            after that, call function <span>_0x59c6d8</span> there is a platform checking, in this case I use is darwin
            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/22.png" style="width: 780px;height: 275px;">

            so, code will call request to URL <span>http://127.0.0.1:1224/client/5/507</span> because I set it to localhost, it should be 404
            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/23.png" style="width: 780px;height: 75px;">

            But if I changed the request directly with curl with the original host http://86.104.74.51:1224/client/5/507, 
            the response are python code encoded using base64 with compressed zlib also using 50x iteration, and automatically executed.
            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/24.png" style="width: 780px;height: 275px;">

            the output from decode like this ( Next I will discuss each function )
            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/26.png" style="width: 780px;height: 775px;">
            as we can see that there are 3 main functions:
            1. <span>download_payload</span>
            2. <span>download_browse</span>
            3. <span>download_mclip</span>

            
            which later, each function will request a file on the host <span>http://86.104.74.51:1224/</span> then will save the file in the homedir 
            and execute it in the background.

            1. <span>download_payload</span>
               make a request URL <a target="_blank" href="http://86.104.74.51:1224/client/5/507">http://86.104.74.51:1224/client/5/507</a> file saved on <span>/homedir/.n2/pay</span> atau <span>/Users/sohai/.n2/pay</span> 
               After that the file is executed. For the decode file, you can check it <a target="_blank" href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sohay666/8d413c8ddb46f1d22c2653fa3968b2b7/raw/5173903cb48e66f3995d05d4b7ecb14e4a578f1d/mal.download_payload.python">here</a>
               
               * There is something interesting, if the OS is Darwin then the code is immediately stopped / exited.
            
            2. <span>download_browse</span>
               make a request URL  <span><a target="_blank" href="http://86.104.74.51:1224/brow/5/507">http://86.104.74.51:1224/brow/5/507</a></span> file di save pada <span>/homedir/.n2/bow</span> atau <span>/Users/sohai/.n2/bow</span> 
               After that the file is executed. For the decode file, you can check it <a target="_blank" href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sohay666/454b946ce354aa4e67241904200bea33/raw/64c57e89ccdd0a1422e70a7e6a1e37e530f651bd/mal.download_browse.python">here</a>
               if i checked the code, it's a <span style="color:red">malware</span> but it is unique enough to find the payload, because it is stored in the pastebin host randomly 
               several URL lists are then XORed using the key <span style="color:red">!!!HappyPenguin1950!!!</span> as an example of pastebin <span>https://pastebin.com/raw/suEqUQBY</span> 
               
               <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/34.png" style="width: 800px;height: 50px;">
               if i XOR again the output is <span>http://23.254.229.101/cat-video</span> ( i created the decoder <a target="_blank" href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sohay666/f1abbcdc5bb82b0a32f8f3572791d346/raw/720708ef124683a472eabfb48330b20c805ea6a4/dec">here</a> )

            3. <span>download_mclip</span>
               make a request URL  <span><a target="_blank" href="http://86.104.74.51:1224/mclip/5/507">http://86.104.74.51:1224/mclip/5/507</a></span> file di save pada <span>/homedir/.n2/mlip</span> atau <span>/Users/sohai/.n2/mlip</span> 
               After that the file is executed. For the decode file, you can check it <a target="_blank" href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sohay666/a3f2ed0aee5c00f71a84d8b4da7ef878/raw/68fd3e2b37b07c41500b39f2bc539e81f2339292/mal.download_mclip.python">here</a>
               specially designed as a keylogger, if an application such as <span>chrome.exe & bold.exe</span> is running, it will record every keyboard stroke
               then there is an ismnemonic check (this is specifically for crypto wallets) in other words, the attacker deliberately targets the crypto wallet then
               all data will be sent to the host <span>http://95.164.7.171:8637/api/clip</span> using the POST method


            go to debugger,
            if the file is successfully downloaded. Then the payload will be saved in the file name <span>/Users/sohai/.sysinfo</span>
            then it will execute the file <span>python3 /Users/sohai/.sysinfo</span>
            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/27.png" style="width: 780px;height: 275px;">

            after that the code will call the function <span>_0x4e6119()</span>, we can see it on the right tab 
            The code successfully lists every application such as Chrome, Brave, Opera,
            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/28.png" style="width: 780px;height: 295px;">
            as well as several plugin extensions on Chrome such as:
            <span>[
                'nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn',
                'ejbalbakoplchlghecdalmeeeajnimhm',
                'fhbohimaelbohpjbbldcngcnapndodjp',
                'ibnejdfjmmkpcnlpebklmnkoeoihofec',
                'bfnaelmomeimhlpmgjnjophhpkkoljpa',
                'aeachknmefphepccionboohckonoeemg',
                'hifafgmccdpekplomjjkcfgodnhcellj',
                'jblndlipeogpafnldhgmapagcccfchpi',
                'acmacodkjbdgmoleebolmdjonilkdbch',
                'dlcobpjiigpikoobohmabehhmhfoodbb',
                'mcohilncbfahbmgdjkbpemcciiolgcge',
                'agoakfejjabomempkjlepdflaleeobhb',
                'omaabbefbmiijedngplfjmnooppbclkk',
                'aholpfdialjgjfhomihkjbmgjidlcdno',
                'nphplpgoakhhjchkkhmiggakijnkhfnd',
                'penjlddjkjgpnkllboccdgccekpkcbin',
                'lgmpcpglpngdoalbgeoldeajfclnhafa',
                'fldfpgipfncgndfolcbkdeeknbbbnhcc',
                'bhhhlbepdkbapadjdnnojkbgioiodbic',
                'gjnckgkfmgmibbkoficdidcljeaaaheg',
                'afbcbjpbpfadlkmhmclhkeeodmamcflc',
            ]</span>
            one of them is <span>metamask</span>.

            there are several steps that I skip, such as (checking each profile until <span>200</span>)
            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/29.png" style="width: 780px;height: 295px;">
            example of iteration <span>71</span>
            <img src="../../images/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project/30.png" style="width: 780px;height: 295px;">
            
            
            and after all the data has been successfully retrieved, finally all the files will be uploaded to the attacker's server.
            in this case, I changed the original host to <span>http://127.0.0.1:1224</span>.

            From dynamic analysis, we can get the List API on host <span>86.104.74.51</span>

            <span>1. GET http://86.104.74.51:1224/client/5/507</span> ( init dropper backdoor )
            <span>2. POST http://86.104.74.51:1224/uploads</span>  ( upload logger )
            <span>3. GET http://86.104.74.51:1224/brow/5/507</span>  ( dropper berupa malware )
            <span>4. GET http://86.104.74.51:1224/mclip/5/507</span>  ( dropper berupa keylogger )
            <span>5. GET http://86.104.74.51:1224/pdown</span>  ( download compailer python3 untuk windows )

            then additional host <span>95.164.7.171</span> as a keylogger container
            <span>1. POST http://95.164.7.171:8637/api/clip</span> (upload keylogger results)

            List of open ports:
            who knows, someone want to try hacking it back maybe . . .

            Conclusion, as developers we must always be careful when someone we don't know runs a program,
            even though it looks like an interview question. And always check the library that we use, maybe the library that we use is also not safe.
